    "Data science isn't just for predicting ad-clicks-it's also useful for social impact! This course is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. We'll explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. In this course, we'll begin by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. In particular, we'll do some natural language processing to prepare the budgets for modeling. Next, we'll have the opportunity to try our own techniques and see how they compare to participants from the competition. Finally, we'll see how the winner was able to combine a number of expert techniques to build the most accurate model."

    "### Multiple types of processing: FunctionTransformer\n",

    "We are working with numeric data that needs imputation, and text data that needs to be converted into a bag-of-words. We'll create functions that separate the text from the numeric variables and see how the .fit() and .transform() methods work.\n",

Instead, you want to deal with these separately and then join the results together using FeatureUnion().\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, you'll still have only two high-level steps in your pipeline: preprocessing and model instantiation.
