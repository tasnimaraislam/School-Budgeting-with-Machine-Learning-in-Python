# School-Budgeting-with-Machine-Learning-in-Python

A case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. 
- We explored a problem related to school district budgeting. 
- By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. 
- We began by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. 
- In particular, we did some natural language processing to prepare the budgets for modeling. 
- Next, we tried our own techniques to build an accurate model.
